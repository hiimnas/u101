        <h1>Designing with Freedom</h1>
        <p>As a designer who values creative expression, I believe that true design freedom comes from exploring innovative and unique ideas while keeping ultimate functionality.
            Whether it's experimenting with color schemes, textures or striking messages, my designs always prioritize creativity and authenticity.</p>
        <h3>This webpage is to showcase my designs from the module U101.</h3>

            <h1>TMA1: T-Shirt Design</h1>
            <p>
                Using my hand as a starting point, I enumerated many possible t-shirt designs, of which I chose this to develop, experimenting with fonts, sizes, orientations, colors, and more...

            <h1>TMA2: Problem Solving & Modelling</h1>
            <p>
                Taking a look at and investigating daily inconveniences, I narrowed down to a problem statement, which was then solved by a number of proposed solutions. From the options, this proposed concept stood out the most and was modelled. It is designed to separate supermarket shelves vertically, providing a way to divide and label individual products/sets of products...

            <p>
                Taking a look at various services, of which I decided on Online Delivery Services <i>(e.g. Amazon)</i>, a board game was designed to educate and provide understanding thereon. By prototyping and testing the game, we were able to provide further improvements and implement them.

            <p>
                Taking a look at the wider world's problems <i>(in this case, the global waste problem)</i>, I was able to identify causes, effects and byproducts, as well as solutions to the problem at hand. By providing a holistic design solution, it may help contribute to solving said problem in the future <i>(if businesses choose to adopt it)</i>.
