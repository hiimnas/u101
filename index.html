        <h1>Designing with Freedom</h1>
        <p>As a designer who values creative expression, I believe that true design freedom comes from exploring innovative and unique ideas while keeping ultimate functionality.
            Whether it's experimenting with color schemes, textures or striking messages, my designs always prioritize creativity and authenticity.</p>
        <h3>This webpage is to showcase my designs from the module U101.</h3>

            <h1>TMA1: T-Shirt Design</h1>
            <p>
                Using a sketch of my hands as a starting point, I enumerated many possible t-shirt designs, experimenting with fonts, sizes, orientations, colors, and more, of which I chose to develop only the one that stood out the most to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>After adequate adjustments and positioning, I printed it successfully onto the T-Shirt.</i>

            <h1>TMA2: Problem Solving & Modelling in Everyday Life</h1>
            <p>
                After investigating daily inconveniences (both small and large) with a range of possible problem statements, I narrowed this down to one:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>"Design something that improves the signage and labeling within the store, making product placement intuitive and clear for customers"</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                for which I designed and modelled a horizontal shelf divider for use in a supermarket.
            </p>

            <h1>TMA3: Board Game Design</h1>
            <p>
                Researching and exploring various services, of which I decided on Online Delivery Services <i>(e.g. Amazon)</i>, a board game was designed to educate and provide understanding thereon. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>By prototyping and testing the game, I was able to provide further improvements and implement them, creating a second iteration of the game that provided an even better experience!</i>

            <h1>TMA4: Real-World Problem</h1>
            <p>
                Taking a look at the wider world's problems <i>(in this case, the global waste problem)</i>, I was able to identify causes, effects and byproducts, as well as solutions to the problem at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The solution chosen was in the form of a compostable dimple tray molded and vacuumed from paper, with a packaging return scheme to circulate any waste directly back to production.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                By providing a holistic design solution both as a product, implementation in business and additional processes to consider, it may help contribute to solving said problem in the future <i>(if businesses choose to adopt it)</i>.
